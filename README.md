# FunctionBlocks
Eclipse based editor for the IEC61499 Standard


IEC 61499 is an open standard for distributed control and automation.

A function block in the IEC 61499 standard is the basic building block from which entire applications may be built. There are two types of function blocks: basic function blocks and composite function blocks. A composite function block contains other composite function blocks and/or basic function blocks. A basic function block contains algorithms and an execution control chart (ECC).

Each function block has event inputs and outputs as well as data inputs and outputs. In a basic function block the execution of an algorithm is triggered by the occurrence of an input event. The executed algorithm then produces new output data from the input data. When the algorithm has finished executing an output event is generated. This output event might then be the input event to another function block.
